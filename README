This is a work-in-progress of a new skin for ZoneMinder version >= 1.24  .
I plan on removing many of the extra (read: usually unused) features of the WebUI and to go with a more simplistic approach, while adding web 2.0 features.
To use this skin, check it out into a new zm/skins directory (I.e. zm/skins/new), then browse to http://yourzm/?skin=new

FEATURES
 * This skin has only been tested in Firefox 3.5.8 for Linux X86_64
 * I _do not_ plan on supporting any non-standards-compliant browsers (read: IE)
 * Filtering is currently only availble by Monitor Name and Date Range
 * Monitors on Console view will ajax refresh at your WEB_REFRESH_IMAGE variable if in Low or Medium bandwidth.
 * Monitors will stream live if in High bandwidth.
 * Clicking on a monitor will "drill into" the associated events for that monitor
 * Filter by additional monitors by checking the corresponding check box.
 * Checking a monitor checkbox will automatically execute the filter (ajax)
 * Clicking on "Specific Date Range" on the Events page will allow you to search by a Date Range.
 * To search by a Date Range, enter both dates (only tested with MM/DD/YYYY) then click "Submit"

BUGS
 * ZM authentication options do not work.  I'm currently using Apache's .htaccess and .htpasswd (mod_basic I suppose)

FUTURE
 * Add "netflix-like" bandwidth test to dynamically determine appropriate image streaming settings.
 * Convert to HTML5.
 * Video playback via HTML5?
