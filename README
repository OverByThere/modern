This is a fork of the work-in-progress skin for ZoneMinder version >= 1.24 by Kyle Johnson. This skin is currently being developed by Emergent Ltd. Any suggestions of features, comments and code are welcome =)

--

I plan on removing many of the extra (read: usually unused) features of the WebUI and to go with a more simplistic approach, while adding web 2.0 features.
To use this skin, check it out into a new zm/skins directory (I.e. zm/skins/new), then browse to http://yourzm/?skin=new

FEATURES
 * While supporting non-standards compliant browsers is not a goal of the project, it may be polyfilled in the future
 * Event playback on multiple cameras at once
 * Timeline of events for playback
 * Single page for live view and playback
 * Filtering is currently only availble by Monitor Name and Date Range
 * Monitors on Console view will ajax refresh at your WEB_REFRESH_IMAGE variable if in Low or Medium bandwidth.
 * Monitors will stream live if in High bandwidth.
 * Clicking on a monitor will "drill into" the associated events for that monitor
 * Filter by additional monitors by checking the corresponding check box.
 * Checking a monitor checkbox will automatically execute the filter (ajax)
 * Clicking on "Specific Date Range" on the Events page will allow you to search by a Date Range.
 * To search by a Date Range, enter both dates (only tested with MM/DD/YYYY) then click "Submit"

BUGS
 * ZM authentication options do not work.  I'm currently using Apache's .htaccess and .htpasswd (mod_basic I suppose)

FUTURE
 * Add "netflix-like" bandwidth test to dynamically determine appropriate image streaming settings.
 * Convert to HTML5.
 * Video playback via HTML5?
 * Add "Take Snapshot" button to event playback
 * Implement widgets
